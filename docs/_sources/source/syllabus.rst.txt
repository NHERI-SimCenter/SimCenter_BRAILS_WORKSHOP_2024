Welcome to this Training Workshop on using BRAILS++. This year's offering will be in an online format. A drawback of an online offering is the lack of interaction among the participants, so we encourage you to be active during the live sessions with questions.
       


Day 1: Image classification, detection, segmentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * In-class presentations
     * Overview of Computer Vision Applications for Natural Hazards: `Slides <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/SimCenter_BRAILS_WORKSHOP_2024/blob/main/presentations/day1/ML_WorkshopIntro.pdf>`_
     * Brief introduction to image classification, detection, segmentation: `Slides <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/SimCenter_DesignSafe_ML_2022/blob/main/presentations/day1/IntroComputerVision.pdf>`_  
     
  * Demo
    * Training a Building Damage Classifier Using BRAILS: `Jupyter Notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/github/NHERI-SimCenter/SimCenter_BRAILS_WORKSHOP_2024/blob/main/notebooks/BRAILS_TransferLearning.ipynb>`_   
     
Day 2: Vision foundation models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Day 3: Using BRAILS for inventory generation and damage detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   #. To run the demo on Day 3, you need to get a Google Maps API key before the class. Follow the instructions: "Using API Keys" in `this link <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key>`_.
